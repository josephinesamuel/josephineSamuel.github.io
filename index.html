    <p>
      I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Business Intelligence & Process Management at HWR Berlin, 
      combining my background in product management and data with a passion for building structured, scalable solutions. 
      Previously, I worked as a Product Manager at Flip and Traveloka, focusing on consumer experience and onboarding.

    <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in <strong>Semarang, Indonesia</strong> — a coastal city on the island of Java, known for its mix of Chinese, Dutch, and Javanese culture.  
      In 2015, I moved to <strong>Jakarta</strong>, Indonesia’s bustling capital and the heart of its tech scene.  
      Indonesia is globally known for <strong>Bali</strong>, its tropical islands, and its people’s warmth and hospitality — things that always remind me of home.

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I enjoy <strong>powerlifting</strong>, <strong>hiking</strong>, and <strong>cooking</strong>.  
      Lately, I’ve surprisingly gotten into anime — even though I used to avoid it. My current watch: <em>Sakamoto Days</em>.
